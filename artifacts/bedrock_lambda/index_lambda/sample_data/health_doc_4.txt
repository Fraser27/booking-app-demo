While FrostFlu is generally not severe and most children recover within a week with proper care and rest, it's essential for parents and caregivers to monitor the child's body temperature closely. In some cases, the lowering of body temperature might require medical attention, especially in very young children.
Health authorities recommend maintaining good hygiene practices, such as regular handwashing and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, to prevent the spread of FrostFlu. Researchers and medical professionals are working on developing effective treatments and vaccines to mitigate the impact of this novel disease on young children's health.
